The present work aims to adapt the formatting algorithm Nanodegree of the Autonomous car engineering message to a Jaguar robotic platform, a robot belonging to a camera that has only one camera, different from the design used as a base, which has three cameras.
Jaguar is controlled by a computer connected to the same {Wireless} text network managed by ROS. The computer received the images provided by Jaguar's camera Rotate and accelerate data complements at the time of image capture. With these data, a neural network presents a prediction model to make an autonomous navigation of the Jaguar. The entire process is performed on Ubuntu operating system and is used for the creation of neural social programs and networks.
